      <h2>ðŸŒŸ Seerah of the Prophet Muhammad ï·º</h2>
      <h3>Birth and Early Life</h3>
      <p>Prophet Muhammad ï·º was born in Makkah in 570 CE. His father Abdullah died before he was born, and his mother Amina passed away when he was six. He was raised first by his grandfather Abdul Muttalib, then by his uncle Abu Talib.</p>

      <h3>Youth and Honesty</h3>
      <p>As a young man, Muhammad ï·º was known for his truthfulness and honesty. People called him "Al-Ameen" (the trustworthy). He worked as a shepherd and later became a successful merchant.</p>

      <h3>Marriage to Khadijah (RA)</h3>
      <p>He married Khadijah (RA), a noble woman who admired his character. They had six children together. In total, the Prophet ï·º had seven children:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Qasim</li>
        <li>Zainab</li>
        <li>Ruqayyah</li>
        <li>Umm Kulthum</li>
        <li>Fatimah</li>
        <li>Abdullah</li>
        <li>Ibrahim</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The First Revelation</h3>
      <p>At age 40, he received his first revelation from Allah through the angel Jibreel in the cave of Hira. These were the first verses of the Qurâ€™an and marked the start of his prophethood.</p>

      <h3>Calling to Islam</h3>
      <p>Prophet Muhammad ï·º began preaching about worshiping one God, Allah. Some people accepted Islam, while others rejected him and even harmed him and his followers.</p>

      <h3>The Hijrah (Migration) to Madinah</h3>
      <p>After facing many hardships, he migrated to Madinah with his followers. This event is called the Hijrah and it marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.</p>

      <h3>Life in Madinah</h3>
      <p>In Madinah, the Prophet ï·º established a strong Muslim community. He built the first mosque and helped Muslims live in peace with others.</p>

      <h3>Important Battles</h3>
      <h4>Battle of Badr</h4>
      <p>This was the first major battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh. Though outnumbered, Muslims won with the help of angels sent by Allah. It showed the power of faith and prayer.</p>

      <h4>Battle of Uhud</h4>
      <p>Muslims were initially winning, but lost because some disobeyed the Prophet ï·º. It taught the importance of obedience and discipline.</p>

      <h4>Battle of Khandaq (The Trench)</h4>
      <p>Muslims defended Madinah by digging a trench. Allah sent strong winds and fear into the hearts of the attackers. It was a victory through strategy and faith.</p>

      <h4>Treaty of Hudaybiyyah</h4>
      <p>A peaceful agreement that seemed unfair at first but led to many accepting Islam. The Prophetâ€™s patience and wisdom brought victory without fighting.</p>

      <h4>Conquest of Makkah</h4>
      <p>After the treaty was broken, the Prophet ï·º entered Makkah peacefully with an army. He forgave his enemies and cleared the Kaaba of idols, showing great mercy and kindness.</p>

      <h3>The Prophetâ€™s Passing</h3>
      <p>Prophet Muhammad ï·º passed away at the age of 63. He left behind the Qur'an and his Sunnah (teachings and actions) to guide us forever.</p>
