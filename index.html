    <h2>Seerah</h2>
    <h3>Birth and Early Life</h3>
    <p>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was born in Makkah in 570 CE. His father Abdullah died before he was born, and his mother Amina passed away when he was six. He was raised first by his grandfather Abdul Muttalib, then by his uncle Abu Talib.</p>

    <h3>Youth and Honesty</h3>
    <p>As a young man, Muhammad ﷺ was known for his truthfulness and honesty. People called him "Al-Ameen" (the trustworthy). He worked as a shepherd and later became a successful merchant.</p>

    <h3>Marriage to Khadijah (RA)</h3>
    <p>He married Khadijah (RA), a noble woman who admired his character. They had six children together. In total, the Prophet ﷺ had seven children:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Qasim</li>
      <li>Zainab</li>
      <li>Ruqayyah</li>
      <li>Umm Kulthum</li>
      <li>Fatimah</li>
      <li>Abdullah</li>
      <li>Ibrahim</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The First Revelation</h3>
    <p>At age 40, he received his first revelation from Allah through the angel Jibreel in the cave of Hira. These were the first verses of the Qur’an and marked the start of his prophethood.</p>

    <h3>Calling to Islam</h3>
    <p>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ began preaching about worshiping one God, Allah. Some people accepted Islam, while others rejected him and even harmed him and his followers.</p>

    <h3>The Hijrah (Migration) to Madinah</h3>
    <p>After facing many hardships, he migrated to Madinah with his followers. This event is called the Hijrah and it marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.</p>

    <h3>Life in Madinah</h3>
    <p>In Madinah, the Prophet ﷺ established a strong Muslim community. He built the first mosque and helped Muslims live in peace with others.</p>

    <h3>Important Battles</h3>
    <p>During the life of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, there were several important battles that taught Muslims about courage, patience, and trusting Allah:</p>

    <h4>Battle of Badr</h4>
    <p>This was the first major battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh. The Muslims had only about 313 soldiers while the Quraysh had over 1,000. But the Muslims had strong faith and made lots of du'a (prayers). Allah sent thousands of angels to help the Muslims, and they won the battle. It showed the power of faith, prayer, and Allah’s help.</p>

    <h4>Battle of Uhud</h4>
    <p>At first, the Muslims were winning the battle. But the archers who were told by the Prophet ﷺ to stay on a hill left their position to collect spoils of war. This gave the Quraysh army a chance to attack from behind. Many Muslims were hurt, and even the Prophet ﷺ was injured. This battle taught Muslims the importance of obeying the Prophet's instructions, no matter what.</p>

    <h4>Battle of Khandaq (The Trench)</h4>
    <p>When the Quraysh and other tribes came to attack Madinah, a smart companion named Salman al-Farsi suggested digging a trench around the city — an idea he knew from Persia. The trench stopped the enemy from entering. Allah sent strong winds and fear into the hearts of the attackers, and they went back without fighting. It was a victory through strategy, teamwork, and trust in Allah.</p>

    <h4>Treaty of Hudaybiyyah</h4>
    <p>In the 6th year after Hijrah, the Prophet ﷺ and 1,400 of his companions set out to perform Umrah in Makkah. They were peaceful and wore no weapons except for travel. The Quraysh stopped them outside Makkah at a place called Hudaybiyyah. After long talks, a treaty was signed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Muslims would return to Madinah that year without performing Umrah.</li>
      <li>They could come back the next year to perform Umrah for three days.</li>
      <li>If anyone from Makkah joined the Muslims without permission, they would be returned. But if a Muslim went to Makkah, they would not be sent back.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many companions felt this was unfair, but the Prophet ﷺ accepted it calmly. Later, many people saw the peaceful nature of Islam and accepted it. This treaty was a big victory without any fighting!</p>

    <h4>Conquest of Makkah</h4>
    <p>In the 8th year after Hijrah, the Quraysh broke the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah when their ally, the tribe of Banu Bakr, attacked the Muslim ally tribe of Khuza'ah. The Quraysh helped Banu Bakr secretly, which broke the treaty.</p>
    <p>The tribe of Khuza'ah asked the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ for help. In response, the Prophet ﷺ began preparing for the conquest. He gathered a powerful army of 10,000 Muslims. These included the Muhajirun (Muslims who migrated from Makkah), the Ansar (Muslims from Madinah), and other supportive tribes like Ashja', Sulaym, Muzaynah, Juhaynah, and Ghifar.</p>
    <p>The Prophet ﷺ kept the plan secret to surprise the Quraysh. When the army reached Makkah, the Quraysh realized they were surrounded and did not resist.</p>
    <p>The Prophet ﷺ entered the city humbly, bowed in thanks to Allah. He announced that anyone who stayed in their homes, in Abu Sufyan’s house, or in the Kaaba would be safe.</p>
    <p>He forgave even his worst enemies. He went to the Kaaba and destroyed all the idols, saying: “Truth has come and falsehood has vanished.” His kindness and mercy inspired many of the people of Makkah to accept Islam that day.</p>

    <h3>Victory in Makkah</h3>
    <p>After many years, the Prophet ﷺ returned to Makkah with a large group of Muslims. He forgave the people who had once harmed him and invited them to Islam with kindness.</p>

    <h3>The Prophet’s Passing</h3>
    <p>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ passed away at the age of 63. He left behind the Qur'an and his Sunnah (teachings and actions) to guide us forever.</p>
